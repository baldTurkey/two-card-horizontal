## Documentation for Business Card

In this project I am attempting to showcase being addept at using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. I took inspiration from a transition I saw in a game trailer and a space poster I saw in an engineering building. (Timestamp 1:28 at https://youtu.be/xFtdhQoOMH0?si=XH02wKt9u3X64Nka) I spent a lot of time making the figma prototype, when I recreated for web it looks pretty plain so I hope to add more going on in the top card in the future. I learned about how html css and javascript work together and about css borders. Also, I have issues with getting the gif to stop after it plays to completion. Apperently if you put a gif in as a <video> element you are able to pause it using the javascript, but my gifs wouldn't show up unless they were under <img> element. I got around this issue by changing the gif to a still image after the amount of time it takes for the gif to finish. Unfortunatly, if the gif lags in playing, it changes before the animation is finished.
